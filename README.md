# Synthetic Images with DCGANs

We design and train Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs and GANs) using Keras API in Python. Using a diverse dataset, 
we utilize DCGAN to learn a mapping from a random Gaussian noise to images from the training distribution in order to produce a synthetic replica of the images. The final product is displayed as a gif.

# Tools:
Python, Tensorflow, Keras
